jExpress
========

A java version of the node express library

This is a very rough implementation of an express style framework using the new features of Java 8 including:

Lambda expressions<br />
Nashorn

To run the application you can run:

The App.java class in the test file. This is an example usage of the java library<br />
The AppInvoker.java class. This will run app.js from within a java library<br />
The app.js file using jjs. This will run the app.js file using nashorn

Note, the code for this is currently on the integration branch, I will pull this readme file down tonight and get that onto the same branch.
